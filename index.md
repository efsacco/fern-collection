Moca is a small town in Northwest Puerto Rico, and these are family photographs which tell the story of the Gonzalez family of Barrio Pueblo. In part, they cover the arc from enslavement to freedom in the Spanish Caribbean.

The collection items are from the collection of Luz Gonzalez and done as part of the Dreamwork Lab 2021.
