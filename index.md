Moca is a small town in Northwest Puerto Rico, and these are family photographs which tell the story of the Gonzalez family of Barrio Pueblo. Their family history covers the arc from enslavement to freedom in the Spanish Caribbean from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, with connections that extend out to different continents. Photographs are somewhat rare until after the 1930s; here are examples of photo postcards that served as formal portraits, a school photograph and snapshot of sisters sitting together, a range of roles and self representations of African descended people of Moca.

The collection items are from the collection of Luz Gonzalez and done as part of the final project of the Fern team for the Minimal Computing & Wax course by Dr. Alex Gil and Mari Nyropp for DreamLab 21 (U Penn 14-17 Jun 2021).
